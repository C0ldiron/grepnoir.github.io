A student at University of Advancing Technology. I have been here for awhile and I graduate in December. I am a blue team member of the UAT CDDC team and I mostly work with securing Active Directory. I also use Linux on a regular basis. I write scripts when I can and am currently working on a huge PowerShell project with a good friend of mine on the team.

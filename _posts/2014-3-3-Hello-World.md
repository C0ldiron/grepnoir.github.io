title: Windows Hardening Guide
---

Well, for the CCDC qualifier coming up. I have had to make a Windows Hardening Guide. I work on the Active Directory and GPO during the competition. I was in charge of writing the guide for Windows so that we would have one for the competition. If I ever figure out how to put it here on my blog, I will do so.

This post will be a quick note on Rootkits.

Rootkit:
---------------
A rootkit is a program made to sustain continued access at the "root" level. This kind of malware modifies core system files. Rootkits are nearly invisible and can be very difficult to detect. Having a rootkit on your system can be detrimental. There is no easy way to find a rootkit. The best thing to do is to look for unusual or bizarre behaviour and going from there.

title: Viruses and Worms
---

Today, I learned about different kinds of malware. For this post I will be explaining what viruses and worms are.

Virus:
------------------
A virus is malware that can reproduce by itself and needs to be executed in order to work. It can be invisible or can be straight up in your face and can cause issues. Just running a program can cause a virus to spread. Viruses can destroy data and corrupt a system. Viruses require a host program to start replicating. Viruses can be found in different areas such as macros, boot sectors, programs, and can also be scripted.

Worm:
------------------
Unlike a virus, a worm does not need a host program to start reproducing. Worms are a type of malware that self replicate and doesn't need a victim to do anything. A worm can find a device that is vulnerable and infect it and spread this same infection across other devices on the network. Worms are very hard to get rid of since they reproduce so quickly and can cause a lot of damage. There are ways to prevent a worm using advanced IDS/IPS and Firewalls to filter out worms but once they are through they aren't much help. Worms in general just suck.

title: Teaching Freshman Windows Hardening Saturday
---

I have been making a few Windows Server 2016 demo boxes for the new freshman at the school. I am teaching tomorrow at our security club. I find it important to spread my knowledge with them about hardening Windows and sometimes even just setting a server up if they haven't before. This is valuable information because they won't really learn how to do this in college unless they take the time to learn on their own. I hope this will help spark their interest. Plus, I need tutoring hours. It's a win-win.

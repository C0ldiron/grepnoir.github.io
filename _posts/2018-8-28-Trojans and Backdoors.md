---

This post I will be talking about Backdoors, Trojans, and RATs.

Backdoors:
---------------
Backdoors are holes in your operating system or software that allow an attacker to access your machine. Malware is often used to make these backdoors on a system. Some malware can create backdoors after using another backdoor another piece of malware created. Some software has built-in backdoors. Old versions of software or operating systems can contain backdoors.

Trojans:
---------------
Trojans are malware that pretends to be a legitimate piece of software, but instead causes havoc to your machine. It doesn't really replicate like other malware. Some trojans can manuever their way around your anti-virus and other security measures and turn them off or avoid them in general. Trojans may open other backdoors for other malicious programs.

RATs:
---------------
Standing for Remote Access Trojan, these guys are a remote administration tool that can take over your device entirely. They are the ultimate trojan. They administrative access to everything on the device. This kind of trojan install keyloggers, look through your camera, gain screen captures, copy files, etc.

Tips to improve prevention:
---------------
Keep backups of your data.
Keep everything up to date.
Don't use unknown software.

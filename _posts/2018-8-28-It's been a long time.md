title: Starting my technical blog.
---

Hey guys,

It's been a long time since I have posted anything but today is the day I officially start blogging my research and learnings. It may be simple or complex stuff, but I will be writing about these things to help me understand what I am learning. I need this to better myself in security and to help others who may read this learn about security topics. I am starting my Security+ 501 training and it is so far going well. After each study session, I plan to write about what I have learned. This will allow me to get those pesky concepts into my head. Wish me luck on my journey.

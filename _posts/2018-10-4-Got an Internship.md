---

Last week while I was at CactusCon, one of the positions I interviewed for got contact with me an offered me the internship. I won't say where (for obvious reasons) but I will be working as a SOC analyst intern. I plan to learn a lot and prove that I am worth working there. I plan on gving it my all.

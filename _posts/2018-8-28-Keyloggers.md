This post will be a quick note on Keyloggers.

Keyloggers:
---------------
Keyloggers are a program that grabs direct keystrokes from a victim's device. These keystrokes can contain valuable information such as login credentials, URLs, email messages, text messages, etc. A keylogger saves all of your input data and saves it for the attackers. Keyloggers usually go around encryption protections and get your keystrokes in clear-text. Keyloggers can also gain data such as data saved to your clipboard, screen captures, searches, basically everything.

Tips to improve prevention:
---------------
Keep everthing up to date (anti-virus, operating system, etc.).
Firewall rules that block unauthorized communication.
Don't use untrusted or unknown software.

title: Ransomware and Crypto-Malware
---

For this post I will be explaining what ransomware and crypto-malware are.

Ransomeware:
-------------------
Ransomware is a type of malware that will take valuable data and lock your computer, only to hold it up for ransom. This makes it difficult to get your data back and it requires you to pay the bad guys money so they will unlock your data and give it back to you...hopefully. The ransomware may be fake and can sometimes impersonate other people (i.e. the police or the government) to make the victims feel as if they have to pay. If the ransomware is fake and/or inefficient, a security professional may be able to get your data back easily.

Cryto-malware:
-------------------
Cryto-malware is a type of ransomware that takes your data and encrypts it. They then hold your data for ransom until you pay them and they give you a decryption key. This kind of malware encrypts your files such as pictures, documents, etc. and allows your operating system to still be used. This kind of attack is effective because the payment method is untraceable and uses public-key cryptography. 

Preventing ransomware:
-------------------
Backups can be used when stored offline to help gain all of your files back. Keeping your antivirus (even though a bit useless) and your operating system up to date is always smart because they are always patching vulnerabilities. Basically, keep everything up to date and don't go clicking on strange links.
